# About Me<br/>
Hi! I am WANG Yifan, a third year student majoring in Data Science and Technology in the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST). My research interest now lies in generative model, especially human motion generation and prediction. Fortunately, I am supervised by [Prof.Chi-Keung Tang](https://cse.hkust.edu.hk/admin/people/faculty/profile/cktang) and [Prof.Yu-Wing Tai](https://yuwingtai.github.io/). I am now enjoying my exchange life in EPFL and I am fortunate to do research with [Prof.Alexandre Alahi](https://people.epfl.ch/alexandre.alahi?lang=en) on transformer-based models for self-supervised action recognition.
