# About Me<br />
Hi! I am Yifan WANG, a second year student majoring in Data Science and Technology in Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST). My research interested lies in generative model, especially human motion generation. Fortunately, I am supervised by [Chi-Keung Tang](https://cse.hkust.edu.hk/admin/people/faculty/profile/cktang) and [Yu-Wing Tai](https://yuwingtai.github.io/).
